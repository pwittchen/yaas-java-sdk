YaaS Java SDK
=============
[YaaS](https://yaas.io) (Hybris as a Service) SDK

Overview
--------

This SDK allows to perform authorized requests to the microservices hidden behind YaaS proxy. 
Please note, this SDK is not an official SAP Hybris project and it does not cover all the features of YaaS. If you would like to learn more about YaaS, read an article on my blog about [basic usage of YaaS as a proxy for the microservice](http://blog.wittchen.biz.pl/basic-usage-of-yaas-as-a-proxy-for-the-microservice/).

Tech stack of the SDK: Java 8, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [OkHttp3](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) with [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)

Quick start
-----------

Exemplary usage of this SDK is as follows:

```java
YaaSProject project = new YaaSProject.Builder()
    .withClientId("YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
    .withClientSecret("YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
    .withOrganization("YOUR_ORGANIZATION")
    .withService("YOUR_SERVICE")
    .withVersion("v1")
    .withZone(Zone.EU)
    .build();

Client client = new YaaS(project);

client.get("path/to/your/endpoint")
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
    .blockingSubscribe(response -> System.out.println(response.body().string()));
```

Client API
----------

`Client` interface supports basic HTTP methods like: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` & `DELETE`.

```java
Flowable<Response> get(final String path);
Flowable<Response> post(final String path, final RequestBody body);
Flowable<Response> put(final String path, final RequestBody body);
Flowable<Response> delete(final String path, final RequestBody body);
Flowable<Response> delete(final String path);
```

Authorization procedure in YaaS
-------------------------------

Authorization procedure of the microservice endpoint is presented in the scheme below.

SDK follows this procedure in each call to the endpoint of the microservice.

In order to build `*.jar` file with SDK, call the following command:

```
./gradlew jar
```

SDK compiled into `*jar` file will be available in `sdk/build/libs/` directory.

Building and running example
----------------------------

In order to build and run sample app located in the `example` directory, call the following command:

```
./gradlew clean build run 
```

Code style
----------

Code style used in the project is called `Square` from Java Code Styles repository by Square available at: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles.
